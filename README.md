# Earthquake-prediction-using-machine-learning
Earthquakes are natural disasters that cause immense loss of life and property, making accurate and timely prediction a crucial scientific challenge. Traditional prediction methods, based on geological and statistical approaches, often fail to identify complex patterns hidden in seismic data. To address this limitation, machine learning techniques
